#Private Trackers

> Before joining a private tracker, it is highly recommended to have some experience in torrenting in public trackers.

Most private trackers have strict rules which are regularly enforced.

## General Advice


- Create a separate identity for private trackers. Using your default internet identity means that there is a high chance of your personal information being found.
- Read everything you can get your hands on. Private trackers usually have strict rules and are not afraid of banning someone if they do not follow them so make sure to read the whole book of rules before you make a post or download.
- Do not Hit and Run. Leeching a file without seeding it for at least a 1:1 ratio is considered a HnR and can easily get you banned from a tracker.
- A significant amount of private trackers are related so getting banned from one can automatically ban you from a few others.
- If you do not understand something, it is best to ask an admin or just ask somewhere else instead.
