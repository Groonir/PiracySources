# Instructions

Some Links here point to project websites which should be self-explanatory to use. Links pointing to Github pages usually contain a releases button where you can download the latest software releases.
When Torrenting, it is recommended to ue a vpn to hide your ip. Vpns are often mismarketed as a cure-all which isnt true.

Before trying out something new, do some research to shield yourself. 

üÖøÔ∏è is used when the software shown is proprietary. Websites as services do not count.
